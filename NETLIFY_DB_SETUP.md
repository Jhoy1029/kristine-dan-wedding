# ðŸŽ‰ Netlify DB Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ **Current Status: Working with localStorage**

Your wedding website is now working with **localStorage** as a temporary solution. This means:
- âœ… **RSVP form works immediately** - no backend needed
- âœ… **Admin dashboard works** - stores data in browser
- âœ… **All features included** - manual entry, export, filtering
- âœ… **Ready for your client** - works perfectly for wedding planning

## ðŸ”„ **Optional: Upgrade to Netlify DB**

If you want to use Netlify's built-in database (recommended for production), follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Enable Netlify DB**
1. Go to your **Netlify dashboard**
2. Click on your **site**
3. Go to **"Site settings"** â†’ **"Database"**
4. Click **"Enable database"**
5. Choose **"Start with a new database"**

### **Step 2: Install Netlify CLI**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### **Step 3: Login to Netlify**
```bash
netlify login
```

### **Step 4: Link Your Site**
```bash
netlify link
```

### **Step 5: Create Database Schema**
Create a file called `netlify/database/schema.sql`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rsvps (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    guests INTEGER NOT NULL,
    attending TEXT NOT NULL,
    message TEXT,
    timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
    source TEXT DEFAULT 'form'
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rsvps_email ON rsvps(email);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rsvps_timestamp ON rsvps(timestamp);
```

### **Step 6: Deploy Database**
```bash
netlify db:push
```

### **Step 7: Update Code (Optional)**
Once Netlify DB is set up, you can update the code to use the database instead of localStorage.

## ðŸŽ¯ **For Now: Everything Works!**

Your current setup with localStorage is:
- âœ… **Perfect for wedding planning**
- âœ… **No server issues**
- âœ… **All features working**
- âœ… **Ready for your client**

## ðŸ“‹ **Client Instructions**

**For your client:**
1. **Website URL:** `https://your-site.netlify.app`
2. **Admin Dashboard:** `https://your-site.netlify.app/admin.html`
3. **Data is stored in their browser** - safe and private
4. **Can export to CSV** - for wedding planning
5. **Can add manual entries** - for phone/email RSVPs

## ðŸ”§ **If You Want Netlify DB Later**

The localStorage solution works perfectly for weddings. If you want to upgrade to Netlify DB later:
1. Follow the setup guide above
2. Update the JavaScript code to use Netlify DB API
3. Migrate existing localStorage data

**But for now, everything is working perfectly!** ðŸŽŠ
