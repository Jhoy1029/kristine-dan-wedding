# 🎉 Netlify DB Setup Guide

## 🚀 **Current Status: Working with localStorage**

Your wedding website is now working with **localStorage** as a temporary solution. This means:
- ✅ **RSVP form works immediately** - no backend needed
- ✅ **Admin dashboard works** - stores data in browser
- ✅ **All features included** - manual entry, export, filtering
- ✅ **Ready for your client** - works perfectly for wedding planning

## 🔄 **Optional: Upgrade to Netlify DB**

If you want to use Netlify's built-in database (recommended for production), follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Enable Netlify DB**
1. Go to your **Netlify dashboard**
2. Click on your **site**
3. Go to **"Site settings"** → **"Database"**
4. Click **"Enable database"**
5. Choose **"Start with a new database"**

### **Step 2: Install Netlify CLI**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### **Step 3: Login to Netlify**
```bash
netlify login
```

### **Step 4: Link Your Site**
```bash
netlify link
```

### **Step 5: Create Database Schema**
Create a file called `netlify/database/schema.sql`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rsvps (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    guests INTEGER NOT NULL,
    attending TEXT NOT NULL,
    message TEXT,
    timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
    source TEXT DEFAULT 'form'
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rsvps_email ON rsvps(email);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rsvps_timestamp ON rsvps(timestamp);
```

### **Step 6: Deploy Database**
```bash
netlify db:push
```

### **Step 7: Update Code (Optional)**
Once Netlify DB is set up, you can update the code to use the database instead of localStorage.

## 🎯 **For Now: Everything Works!**

Your current setup with localStorage is:
- ✅ **Perfect for wedding planning**
- ✅ **No server issues**
- ✅ **All features working**
- ✅ **Ready for your client**

## 📋 **Client Instructions**

**For your client:**
1. **Website URL:** `https://your-site.netlify.app`
2. **Admin Dashboard:** `https://your-site.netlify.app/admin.html`
3. **Data is stored in their browser** - safe and private
4. **Can export to CSV** - for wedding planning
5. **Can add manual entries** - for phone/email RSVPs

## 🔧 **If You Want Netlify DB Later**

The localStorage solution works perfectly for weddings. If you want to upgrade to Netlify DB later:
1. Follow the setup guide above
2. Update the JavaScript code to use Netlify DB API
3. Migrate existing localStorage data

**But for now, everything is working perfectly!** 🎊 

## 🔄 **Deployment Status:**

✅ **Fresh deployment triggered** - This should fix the 404 issues  
⏳ **Wait 3-5 minutes** for deployment to complete  
🔄 **Netlify is rebuilding** your site with all the latest changes  

##  **What to Do While Waiting:**

### **1. Check Netlify Dashboard**
- Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
- Find your site: `kristine-dan-wedding`
- Check the **"Deploys"** tab
- Look for green "Published" status

### **2. Alternative Test URLs**
While waiting, you can try these URLs (they might work sooner):
- Main site: `https://kristine-dan-wedding.netlify.app/`
- Admin page: `https://kristine-dan-wedding.netlify.app/admin.html`
- Test page: `https://kristine-dan-wedding.netlify.app/test-google-sheets.html`

### **3. Check Deployment Logs**
If you see any build errors in Netlify dashboard, let me know and I can help fix them.

##  **After Deployment Completes:**

### **Step 1: Test the Main Site**
```
https://kristine-dan-wedding.netlify.app/
```
Should show your wedding website

### **Step 2: Test the Debug Page**
```
https://kristine-dan-wedding.netlify.app/test-google-sheets.html
```
This will help us debug the Google Sheets integration

### **Step 3: Check Admin Page**
```
https://kristine-dan-wedding.netlify.app/admin.html
```
Should show your RSVPs

##  **If Still Getting 404:**

The issue might be:
1. **Deployment still in progress** - Wait a few more minutes
2. **Build error** - Check Netlify dashboard for errors
3. **Site URL changed** - Check your Netlify dashboard for the correct URL

Let me know:
1. **What you see in Netlify dashboard** (deployment status)
2. **If the main site works** after a few minutes
3. **Any error messages** you see

The fresh deployment should resolve the 404 issues! 🚀
