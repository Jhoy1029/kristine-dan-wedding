# Deployment Trigger

This file was created to trigger a new deployment after adding the Google Sheets environment variable.

## What This Does:
- Triggers Netlify to redeploy your site
- Activates the GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL environment variable
- Ensures your RSVP function can access the Google Sheets integration

## Next Steps:
1. After deployment completes, test your RSVP form
2. Check that RSVPs are being saved to Google Sheets
3. Verify the admin page shows the data

## Environment Variable Status:
- Variable Name: GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL
- Status: Ready for deployment
- Function: rsvp.js (updated with Google Sheets integration)

## Current Issue:
- Site showing 404 errors
- Need to trigger fresh deployment
- Debug tools added for Google Sheets integration
